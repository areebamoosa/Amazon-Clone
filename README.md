# Amazon Clone

This is a basic static front-page clone of Amazon's homepage, built using only HTML and CSS. I originally created this project during my early days of learning web development to practice HTML structure and CSS styling. Although it's a beginner-level project, I still wanted to share it as part of my learning journey and growing portfolio.

##  Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- No responsiveness (desktop view only).

##  Features

- Header with logo, search bar, and navigation links
- Simple hero section and product categories layout
- Basic footer layout
